> Convert unformatted JSON into pretty-printed JSON and send it as a shareable web link. That's it!
> ðŸ¤ª

Format and view ugly JSON strings in a pretty-printed expandable tree view on the web. Share the
view with others via its URL link. Under the hood, it uses
[svelte-json-view](https://github.com/zerodevx/svelte-json-view) to generate the view, and
[zipurl](https://github.com/zerodevx/zipurl) to compress the stringified JSON into a smaller,
URL-safe data slug.
